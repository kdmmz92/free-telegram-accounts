Telegram is a cross-platform instant messaging software whose client is free and open source software, but the server is proprietary. Users can exchange encrypted and self-destructing messages with each other and send all types of files such as photos and videos. The client is available for mobile, desktop, and web, and has an open application program interface, so there are many third-party clients available.
